    <h1> About </h1>
    <body>
        Stefan LÃ¼tschg was born in Santiago, Chile. They moved to the United States when they were 6 years old and have always been a sci-fi nerd.
        Stefan first became interested in the idea of BCIs as a teenager through video games depicting the ethical and societal challenges of human augmentation with neural implants and prosthetics, namely the <i>Deus Ex</i> franchise. 
        He would be exposed to Brain Computer Interfaces during his time at Boston University, learning about the research done at the BrainGate consortium based in Brown University, and in frequent visits to the Neurable office in Boston.
